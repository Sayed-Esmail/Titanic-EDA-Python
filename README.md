# Titanic Dataset Analysis ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

> A complete data exploration project using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze the Titanic dataset.

---

## Overview
This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Elevvo Pathways**.  
The goal was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic Titanic dataset, uncover survival patterns, calculate key metrics, and visualize insights professionally.

## Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values:  
  - `Age` ‚Üí filled with median  
  - `Cabin` ‚Üí dropped due to high missing rate  
  - `Embarked` ‚Üí filled with mode  
- Corrected data types and ensured consistency across features.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculated key metrics (KPIs):  
  - Overall Survival Rate  
  - Survival Rate by Gender  
  - Survival Rate by Passenger Class  
  - Survival Rate by Embarkation Port  
  - Average Age by Survival  
- Group-based insights to understand patterns in survival.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
- Created professional charts to visualize key insights:  
  - **Barplots** for survival by gender and passenger class  
  - **Horizontal Barplot** for clearer class comparison  
  - **Stacked Histogram with KDE** for age distribution by survival  
  - **Clustered Barplot (Catplot)** for survival by class & gender  
  - **Correlation Heatmap** for numeric feature relationships



## Key Learnings
- Transform raw data into actionable insights  
- Communicate patterns and relationships effectively through KPIs and visualization  
- Practice Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib in a professional data analytics workflow
